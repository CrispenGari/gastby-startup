Objective:

- The goal is to learn the Gatsby ecosystem and start developing some cool application with it.

## Framework: **`Gatsby.js`**

All the code that I will be writing here will will be based on the [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/t) docs.

### Setting up Gatsby

1. Installation of the Gatsby CLI
   Run the following command to install the gatsby cli.

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

2. Test if the `cli` is installed in my machine

```shell
gatsby --version
```

When you get the version then we are ready to rock!!

3. Creating a new Gatsby.js app.
   To create a new Gatsby app we run the following command:

```shell
gatsby new
```

You will then answer some questions and we are ready to go!!

### Using `yarn`.

Delete the `package-lock.json` file and run the following command

```shell
yarn
```
